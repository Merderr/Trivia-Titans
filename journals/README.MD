1. `Functionality`: Articulate the capabilities of your app or service. :hammer_and_wrench:

- E.g.: Our RESTful API enables CRUD operations for movie reviews.

2. `User Stories/Scenarios`: Outline key use-cases, ideally using Gherkin syntax. :cucumber:

- E.g.: `Given` a user is logged in, `When` they post a review, `Then` it appears on their profile.

3. `Intended Market`: Clearly define your user persona and target demographic. :dart:

- E.g.: Aimed at cinephiles who appreciate algorithmic review recommendations.

4. `Stretch Goals`: Document “nice-to-haves” in your product roadmap. :rainbow:

- E.g.: Implement a recommendation engine via collaborative filtering.

5. `Onboarding`: Detail the local dev setup, branching strategy, .env, 3rd party api keys, and CI/CD pipeline. :rocket:

- E.g.: Fork the repo, clone locally, install dependencies via `npm install`, and checkout to a feature branch.

6. `Tech Stack`: Specify technologies, libraries, and frameworks. :books:

- E.g.: React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker.

7. `Journaling`: Maintain a dev log, perhaps in a `CHANGELOG.md`. :scroll:
8. `Documentation`: Attach DB schemas, wireframes, and API contracts. :clipboard:
   -E.g.: point to the documents dir
9. `Issue Tracking`: Link to your Linear or JIRA board for bug tracking. :ladybug:
   -E.g. - links or screenshoots, could be included in the doc’s dir
10. `Testing`: Describe unit tests. :white_check_mark:
    -E.g. - <student name> : < location of test worked on>
