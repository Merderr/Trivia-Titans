# 11/16/2023: Backend Trivia Questions:
Worked on how to get questions from our Trivia Questions api. The one we planned to use was down today, which leads us to feel that the api we want to use is unreliable.

# 11/16/2023: Backend Trivia Questions:
Instead of using an unreliable api, we decided to create our own bank of questions. With ChatGPT assistance we are able to specifically ask for the program to create a series of questions in the category, style, difficulty, and format we need to insert into our questions sql table. Created a sql file that automatically runs during a docker compose that automatically inserts 50 test questions for us to play with during development of the game play.

# 11/20/2023: Backend Authorization
Worked with the Team in a mob coding session to get backend authorization working with JWT-down. It was a difficult process, but after some help we eventually got it working.

# 11/21/2023: Frontend Authorization
Worked on getting frontend authorization working with JWT-Down. Ran into a lot of issues as JWT-Down doesn't work well with VITE-REACT and even though it was created to make authorization easier it is a rigid setup that is difficult to modify. In the future I will not be using it for my frontend or backend authorization.
